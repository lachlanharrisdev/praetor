<h2>Introduction</h2>

Praetor is a CLI tool built to integrate with your team's existing notetaking workflows, while building an immutable chain of events that helps you reconstruct your entire engagement.

<br/>

<div align="center"> 
  <blockquote><i>"Praetor records what you did, when you did it, and what you knew at the time - automatically"</i></blockquote>
</div>

<br/>

Additionally, it brings plenty of utilities aimed at lowering the friction of notetaking in penetration testing, by offering a fully integrated and cohesive set of commands to run commands, capture output, take quick notes, record credentials securely, modify or delete your past notes, and view and reconstruct any part of your engagement.

<h2 align="right">Get Started</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/praetor/releases/) page and download the desired version & `checksums.txt` file. It should look like `praetor_{version}_{os}_{arch}.targ.gz`
2. Run the following commands in your shell to extract and move to your `bin`:
```sh
tar xzf praetor_{version}_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz
sudo mv pt /usr/local/bin/
```
3. (Optional) Before moving to `bin`, verify the checksums:
```sh
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
```
4. Verify the installation succeeded
```sh
pt version
```

<br/>
<h3>Usage</h3>

`pt` has countless methods of use. There's no one correct way to use it and it all depends on your environment, existing methods of administration and the needs of your team. It's best to keep up with the documentation and refer to each individual commands use.

Some basic usage could look as follows:

1. Create a new engagement directory
```bash
$ pt init test-eng
/home/{user}/engagements/test-eng/

$ cd test-eng
```
2. Add any file to sync
```bash
$ nano final_report.md
$ pt sync add final_report.md
```
3. Record a tool output
```bash
$ nmap -sC 123.45.67.89 | pt capture

# or:
$ nmap -sC -o nmap_result.txt 123.45.67.89
$ pt capture nmap_result.txt

# or:
$ pt run nmap -sC 123.45.67.89
```
4. View the last few events
```bash
$ pt list 3
```

<br/>

<h2 align="right">Contributing</h2>

<br/>

Praetor follows most standard conventions for contributing, and accepts any contributions from documentation improvements, bug triage / fixes, small features or any updates for [issues in the backlog](https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/praetor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22status%3A%20backlog%22). For more information on contributing please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/praetor/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

<br/>
<h3>Codespaces</h3>

Praetor has full support for Github Codespaces. These are recommended for small changes or devices with no access to a Linux environment. You can use the buttons below to open the repository in a web-based editor and get started.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/lachlanharrisdev/praetor?quickstart=1)

<h3>Dev Containers</h3>

We also have full support for Dev Containers. These provide a reproducible development environment that automatically isolates the project and installs the officially supported toolchain. 

Clicking the below button will open up VS Code on your local machine, clone this repository and open it automatically inside a development container.

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20In%20Dev%20Container-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/praetor)

<h3>Local Development</h3>

For local development, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lachlanharrisdev/praetor/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Again, we follow most conventions so local development involves the standard flow of `fork-PR-merge`.
